1. Download Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    - windows installer (LTS) is good
2. Install gulp through node:
    - once node is installed, open a new CMD and run:
        npm install --global gulp-cli


Next step, install the dependencies
3. from project root directory, in cmd run:
    npm i
    - this checks the packages/dependencies listed in the "package.json"
      file and downloads them into the "node_modules" dir


Gulp

- a task runner. You create a script "gulpfile.js" which it runs,
  and it runs whatever tasks you've created for it. Some of 
  the most common uses are for front end build tasks such as:
  - concatenating js files
  - processing css superset formats
