1. Download Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    - windows installer (LTS) is good
2. Install gulp through node:
    - once node is installed, open a new CMD and run:
        npm install --global gulp-cli
3. Install bower through node:
    - run command:
        npm install -g bower

Next step, install the dependencies
4. from project root directory, in cmd run:
    npm i
    - this checks the packages/dependencies listed in the "package.json"
      file and downloads them into the "node_modules" dir
5. from project root directory, in cmd run:
    bower i


Gulp
main site: http://gulpjs.com/
github: https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp
- a task runner. You create a script "gulpfile.js" which it runs,
  and it runs whatever tasks you've created for it. Some of 
  the most common uses are for front end build tasks such as:
  - concatenating js files
  - processing css superset formats

bower
main site: https://bower.io/
- front end package manager.
- manages front end stuff like javascreipt libraries, css libraries,
 fonts, etc.
- it's analagous to python's PIP package manager
