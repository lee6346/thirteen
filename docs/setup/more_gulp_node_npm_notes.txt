Hey, so this is a temp doc just to get you going for tonight or tomorrow.
I modified the "gulp_bower.txt" doc, you can follow that to install
node.js and gulp

Just a few more notes/comments on node and gulp:

- when you install node.js, it comes paired with npm (node package manager).
    - both "node" and "npm" are set to path, so you can immediately begin using
      it.
    - to install our front end app dependencies, which includes not only
      3rd party javascript libraries, but also other javascript gulp packages,
      node relies on the "package.json" file in which you specify the specific
      packages along with their version numbers.
    - in CMD, running "npm install" (or "npm i" for short) will have node search
      the current dir for the "package.json" file, and install all the dependencies
      in a "node_modules" dir, which it places in the same current dir.
        - Also note that the number of packages you see inside node_modules will 
          probably be much greater than what you have specified in package.json.
          This is because it goes through all YOUR specified dependencies, and 
          recursively installs everything that those packages needs (each package
          has its' own package.json)

- After installing node, you should install gulp.
    - The order is important here. Gulp is a program written on top of node, so
      you literally cant run it without have node installed on the same machine.
    - once installed, running "gulp" in CMD will search the current path for a file
      called "gulpfile.js" and run the "default" task. 
        - You can also specify particular tasks to run by running "gulp *taskname*"
        - our current default task runs a complete copy of all our assets into
          the static folder so django can serve them, along with starting to
          watching our JS and SCSS assets so it can auto build and copy them over
          every time we make changes
    - lastly, consider that when using gulp's watch features, every time you 
      change a currently watched file's name, or add a new file you want to include 
      to be copied or watched, you need to rerun gulp.
